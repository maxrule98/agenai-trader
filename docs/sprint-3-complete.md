## Deliverables

### 1. NATS Utilities

- Typed subject helpers for v1 schema
- Bus interface and MemoryBus implementation
- Unit tests for pub/sub round-trip

### 2. Risk Rule Pack

- Pure, deterministic rules: max daily loss, exposure, leverage cap, stale feed
- Zod validation for RiskVerdict
- Unit tests for all rules

## Validation

- All code strictly typed, deterministic, and production-ready
- All tests pass (see `pnpm test` output)
- Directory structure and file placement match monorepo standards

## Next Steps

- Review integration points for gateway, trader, and sim
- Extend risk rules as needed for new venues or strategies
